1. Go into the massdrop_alt_keymap folder in terminal. Run "vagrant up"
2. Run "vagrant ssh"
3. Make any changes to keyboards/massdrop/alt/keymaps/jdpepperman/keymap.c through vscode or something.
4. In the vagrant terminal, cd into the vagrant folder.
5. Run "make massdrop/alt:jdpepperman"
6. Plug the alt into a usb port. Leave it alone for now.
7. Back in a mac terminal, run "mdloader_mac --first --download massdrop_alt_jdpepperman.bin --restart"
	7b.  ./mdloader_windows.exe --first --download massdrop_alt_jdpepperman.bin --restart
8. While it's scanning, hit Fn + B on the keyboard to go to DFU mode.

That should do it.
